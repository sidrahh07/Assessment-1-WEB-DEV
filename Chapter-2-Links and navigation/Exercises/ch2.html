    <h2 id="plot" style="background-color: cadetblue;  color: white; text-align: center;">The Plot</h2>
    <p> Arcane is basically a story about two sisters, Vi and Jinx, 
    who grow up in the undercity of Piltover, 
    a city divided between the rich, tech-advanced topside and the struggling, crime-ridden underground called
    Zaun. <br>
    As kids, Vi and Jinx (whose real name is Powder) are caught in a conflict between the oppressed people
    of Zaun and the enforcers of Piltover. A heist gone wrong ends up changing their lives forever, leading to 
    Powder accidentally causing a tragedy that gets their adoptive father, Vander, killed. Vi, heartbroken and 
    blaming Powder, walks away—only to be taken by the enforcers, leaving Powder alone. That's when the villain, 
    Silco, steps in and raises her as his own, turning her into the chaotic, unpredictable Jinx. <br>
    Years later, Piltover is booming thanks to Hextech, a new magical technology created by Jayce and Viktor, 
    but tensions with Zaun are rising. Vi, who has been imprisoned, gets released by Caitlyn, a Piltover enforcer,
    and together they try to stop Silco and save Jinx. But Jinx has gone too far, caught between her love for Vi 
    and her loyalty to Silco. <br>
    By the end, everything spirals out of control—Jinx makes a devastating choice, the tension between Piltover
    and Zaun reaches its peak. the season ends on a massive cliffhanger that could change everything.
    It's a mix of action, deep character drama, and incredible world-building, all wrapped in stunning,
    action-packed animation.</p>
